# CacheThreader: A Multi-Threaded Proxy Server with Cache

CacheThreader is a high-performance proxy server implemented in **C** that leverages **multi-threading**, **semaphores**, and the **LRU caching algorithm** to efficiently handle concurrent HTTP requests. It supports both cached and non-cached modes, optimizing system responsiveness and reducing server-side traffic.
